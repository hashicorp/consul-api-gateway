        - [x] HostnameConflict
        - [x] ProtocolConflict

      - [x] Detached
        - [x] Attached
        - [x] ~~PortUnavailable~~ *unused, as the only time a port will be unavailable is if we can't schedule the Gateway due to host port binding, which will result in a gateway `Schedule` status of `NoResources`*

        - [x] UnsupportedProtocol *marked for any non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols for now*

        - [x] ResolvedRefs
        - [x] InvalidCertificateRef
        - [x] InvalidRouteKinds
        - [ ] RefNotPermitted *this is unclear from the spec, talks about setting `RefNotPermitted` on the route in one place, and on the listener in another -- pretty sure it shouldn't be on the listener*

        - [x] ListenersNotValid

        - [x] Group/Kind *only Kubernetes services with Consul entries supported for now*
        - [x] Name/Namespace lookups
        - [x] Port *check for existence, but ignored for Kubernetes services since we get our ports from Consul*
  - [x] Status
    - [x] Parent status updates on insertion
      - [x] Accepted *note that all of these are custom since the spec doesn't define reasons for the conditions*
        - [x] *Accepted* indicates route accepted by the gateway parent reference
        - [x] *InvalidRouteKind* rejected by the gateway because it doesn't match the listener allowed routes
        - [x] *ListenerNamespacePolicy* rejected by the gateway because it doesn't match the listener namespace policy
        - [x] *ListenerHostnameMismatch* rejected because of hostname mismatches between listener and route
        - [x] *BindError* generic error for things like label parsing issues
      - [x] ResolvedRefs *note that all of these are custom since the spec doesn't define reasons for the conditions*
        - [x] *ResolvedRefs* indicates that we were able to resolve all route references to things like Kubernetes/Consul services
        - [x] *ServiceNotFound* weren't able to find the referenced Kubernetes service
        - [x] *ConsulServiceNotFound* weren't able to find the referenced Consul mesh service
        - [x] *RefNotPermitted* weren't able to route across namespaces due to a missing ReferenceGrant
        - [x] *InvalidKind* backend reference is an unknown or unsupported kind
        - [x] *BackendNotFound* backend reference is a supported kind but does not exist

- [x] TCPRoute - we are limited by Consul's ability to only route to a single TCP-based upstream, so TCP-based Gateway listeners only support a single TCPRoute with a single rule with a single backend; otherwise, either the TCPRoute is considered invalid or the Gateway status is set as having conflicting routes.
- [ ] TLSRoute - TODO
- [x] UDPRoute *not supported*
- [x] ReferenceGrant - Routes currently require ReferenceGrant for all BackendRefs, and do not support partial acceptance if any BackendRefs are unpermitted
  - [x] From
    - [x] HTTPRoute
    - [x] TCPRoute
    - [ ] TLSRoute
    - [ ] UDPRoute
    - [x] Gateway
  - [x] To
    - [x] Service
    - [x] Secret
- [x] ReferencePolicy - Supported for backwards compatibility, will be removed in a future release
