hostnames:
  type: array
  description: "Hostnames defines a set of hostname that should match against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute to process the
                request. This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:
                  
                  1. IPs are not allowed.
                  2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label.
                  
                If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  
                  - A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have
                    specified at   least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  - A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified
                    at least   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example, `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match.
                    On the other   hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
                    
                If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. 
                For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net`
                must not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,
                then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
