description: "GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the
  user for creating Gateway resources. \n It is recommended that this resource
  be used as a template for Gateways. This means that a Gateway is based on
  the state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to
  the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing
  Gateways. This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes
  to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate
  GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented
  by the implementation. \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass,
  implementations MUST add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io`
  finalizer on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass
  associated with a Gateway is not deleted while in use. \n GatewayClass is
  a Cluster level resource."
fields:
  - name: controllerName
    type: string
    description: "ControllerName is the name of the controller that is
      managing Gateways of this class. The value of this field MUST be
      a domain prefixed path. \n Example: \"example.net/gateway-controller\".
      \n This field is not mutable and cannot be empty. \n Support: Core"
  - name: description
    type: string
    description: Description helps describe a GatewayClass with more details.
  - name: parametersRef
    type: object
    description: "ParametersRef is a reference to a resource that contains
      the configuration parameters corresponding to the GatewayClass.
      This is optional if the controller does not require any additional
      configuration. \n ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes
      resource, i.e. ConfigMap, or an implementation-specific custom resource.
      The resource can be cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped. \n If the
      referent cannot be found, the GatewayClass's \"InvalidParameters\"
      status condition will be true. \n Support: Custom"
